**Emulation of a Spot Market for Interdomain Connectivity Using Kathará.**

Emulated a distributed network of Autonomous Systems and cloud-based environments representing a spot market involving ISPs, transit providers, and IXPs, using Kathará, a container-based network emulation platform built on Docker and extensible to Kubernetes for larger-scale deployments. Implemented OSPF for intra-domain routing and BGP for interdomain routing.

Investigated the technical feasibility of routing money in the Internet ecosystem through a spot market, where transit providers sell excess capacity on a best-effort basis. Applied Economic Software-Defined Exchanges (ESDXs) as trusted intermediaries to tie the forwarding service to economic incentives. Analyzed technical and economic requirements, evaluated distributed network performance, and identified risks such as cascading failures and market imbalance.
